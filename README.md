# MemeJungle
Social network website

There are features like text and image bases posts, trendings based on hashtags in text post and captions, reacting with emojis (with grouping upto 3), discover section, follow system, super like on posts directly goes to profile, notifcations, comments, comment likes, download text post as an image with just a click, welcome & forgot password email, and so much more. Most them are developed from scratch instead of using any package as packages didn't meet conditons.

Most important technical challenges were windowing of large list of posts, implementing JWT based authentication system, lossless compression of images, caching images in frontend within a limit using JavaScript. At backend, writing complex mongodb queries, setting up AWS configurations, configuring SSL, storing files to AWS S3, etc.
